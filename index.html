        <p class="text__p">During our experiments with inlining SVG icons at our company, we discovered that browsers responded to linking SVG set into a page differently. However, we would like to have a universal and stable method, which works in all the browsers with support SVG.</p><p class="text__p">Trials and errors led us to this scenario:
to some variable in a variable in JavaScript.</p><ol>
<li>Add the JavaScript file in the bundle of all JavaScript files. Then, link this
bundle in <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section.</li>
<li>Before the first usage of SVG add an empty element (placeholder) and insert  the content of SVG-string here.</li>
</ol>
<p class="text__p">Thus, we achieved the caching of SVG pictograms similar to how it happens to other static files. Also, we overcame a problem of linking
an external SVG file in IE.</p>

        <p class="text__p">I work on a huge project — in fact, on nothing else than the Yandex SERP (Search Engine Results Page).
As in any other large project, people here work with enourmously huge chunks of CSS code; a separate developer team does the maintenance.</p><p class="text__p">When different people create and edit CSS using different tools and approaches, the resulting code becomes complicated, messy and inconsistent. For example, different developers apply different order for vendor prefixes, some of them omit quotes around urls while others don&#39;t. I could even imagine that in a hotfix rush, one could add something like <code>position: relative</code> to a rule set which already has <code>position: absolute</code> buried deep inside between other definitions... a happy debugging session guaranteed!</p><p class="text__p">Regarldess of the aforementioned problems, our CSS repository shines with consistent code style and looks perfect, all of it.</p><p class="text__p">How do we do it?</p>
